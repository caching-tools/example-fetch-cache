# Next.js Third-Party Library Caching Example

## Overview

This app is a Next.js project that showcases how third-party libraries like `axios` interact with Next.js' caching mechanism. It compares the caching abilities of native `fetch` API with `axios` in Next.js. The example demonstrates custom caching and revalidation implementations by tag for third-party libraries, providing insights into managing external data fetching with caching strategies in a Next.js application.
